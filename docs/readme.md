## Analysis

### Stakeholders

#### James

James is a member of my computing class and is interested in using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for navigation, but needs a program that can reliably do this. He has already tried a few apps that use OSM, so he will be able to provide insights to how my engine compares to results from other programs, as well as suggest areas where other engines fall short.

#### Andrew

Andrew is also in my computing class so I will have frequent contact with him. One use case he looks forward to trying is finding the optimal route to get to the local bakery from school. He wants to have easy-to read instructions and the total distance he'll have to walk.

<!-- TODO Ili?? -->

### Problem definition

A routing engine is a piece of software that calculates a route between two points in the world, following a pre-defined network of paths or roads. Routing engines first became commonly used with satnavs and similar automotive navigation systems ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_navigation)) that provide live directions for driving.

Nowadays, "navigation apps" are the most common way to interact with a routing engine. They make the features of a routing engine accessible through a graphical interface that lets users enter a starting point and destination, from which a route will be calculated and plotted on a map.

 <!-- perform the same task, and can be used for driving as well as walking or cycling. -->

<!-- Modern routing engines use geographic data of roads to  -->

### Justification of computational approach

The task of finding an efficient route between two geographic locations has some complexities, such as the need for an algorithm to chose which paths to explore without knowing for sure which ones will be optimal. However, these challenges have successfully been overcome by a variety of programs that incorporate routing engines. This task is solvable with an algorithm because it of four characteristics: an initial situation, clear inputs and outputs, clearly defined logic, and a clear goal. These will be discussed in detail below.

#### Initial situation

The routing engine is provided with coordinates for a starting point, and coordinates for the ending point. The initial situation for the program will be a graph that represents a network of paths for the area that will be covered by the routing query. The graph will be generated by processing map data from OpenStreetMap with the following steps:

1. Extract ways that represent a walkable section of a route, e.g. paths, roads, plazas. This will be done by checking for corresponding top-level tags, e.g. `highway=footway`.
2. Also extract the nodes from each way. Untagged nodes that aren't intersections can be ignored.
3. Use a recursive algorithm to walk through the extracted map data, building a graph where intersections and barriers are represented as graph nodes, and segments of walkable ways are represented as edges. A weight for each node and edge will be calculated to represent how desirable it would be to navigate that node, or walk along that edge.

#### Clear goal

Its goal is to provide the user with a real-world path that they can follow on foot to navigate from the start to the end point, as well as a series of steps that describe the route in text. The route should follow walkable map objects to ensure it makes sense as a route. The engine should generate routes that are desirable to a user looking to travel safely and efficiently (i.e. minimising the effort required to follow the route).<!-- Planing walks for leisure (e.g. circular path walks through woods) --> To achieve this, the engine will follow the following principles:

- Prefer a shorter-distance route, all else being equal
- Prefer pavements over roads without pavements
- Prefer paved paths over unpaved ones
- Prefer signalled crossings to unsignalled ones, especially if crossing a busy road
- Prefer well-marked paths to difficult-to-spot ones
- Avoid obstructions that may pose an issue for pedestrians (e.g. fallen trees)

In addition to the points above, the most desirable route for a user will depend on their own preferences and physical abilities. To accommodate this, the engine will be configurable to prioritise routes that are suitable for the specific user. Goals that should be configurable are:

- Avoid high kerbs, and prefer crossings with flush kerbs
- Prefer crossings with tactile paving
- Prefer paths that are lit at night
- Avoid steps
- Avoid large numbers of steps
- Prefer steps where a handrail is available
- Prefer paths wide enough for a wheelchair
- Prefer crossings with audible indicators
- Prefer crossings with tactile indicators

#### Clear inputs and outputs

Users will interact with the routing engine through a basic web-based UI. There will be text fields to enter start and end points, using either coordinates or addresses (which are converted to coordinates using a geocoding API).

Once the route is calculated, it will be outputted by rendering it on a map rendered by the [Leaflet library](https://leafletjs.com/). It will also display a textual list of directions that can be followed.

#### Clearly defined logic

The front-end will use the [Nominatim API](https://nominatim.org/) to convert the inputted start and end locations to coordinates, or use coordinates directly if provided. The pair of coordinate pairs will then be passed to the routing engine.

The routing engine will use the routing graph to find the optimal route between the two points using a pathfinding algorithm, such as A\*, to find a route that will be desirable for the user (as defined above).

### Problem research

While I have a general mental idea of what the routing engine should accomplish, it's essential to research similar programs, as well as stakeholders, to gain a well-rounded idea of what features are most important for my program, as well as how to make the user interface as intuitive as possible for my target audience.

#### Initial stakeholder interviews

I will interview each of my stakeholders to gain an understanding of what they would like from a routing engine, and accompanying GUI. I plan to ask the following questions:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Justification</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>How often do you use an app or website to get directions?</td>
      <td>An idea of how frequently my app will guide my UI design, e.g. I may prioritise/deprioritise being able to quickly get directions</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>How often do you use an app or website to get directions for walking?</td>
      <td>To confirm or deny my hypothesis that predict that navigation apps will be used for pedestrian navigation much less frequently than for other modes of transport</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>In what situations are you more likely to use an app for pedestrian navigation?</td>
      <td>Tells me the specific situations that my app will likely be used in, so that I can optimise the features and UI accordingly. I hypothesise unknown city centres to be one such situation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What apps do you use to get directions?</td>
      <td>This could indicate other projects that would be useful to research</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are your main issues with the currently-available apps for routing?</td>
      <td>Identifying pain points in similar apps will provide ideas for areas to focus on to give my app unique appeal.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Is it more helpful to see a pedestrian route plotted on a map, or a list of directions?</td>
      <td>To decide how much development time to dedicate to different features, and ensure the result is presented in the most useful way.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What factors should be considered when the program decides which route is best?</td>
      <td>Gives ideas for which factors should be included into the graph weights, and how much time to spend optimising those factors.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Would a mobile or desktop app be more important for you?</td>
      <td>I expect that mobile support will be very useful, so that directions can be obtained while out and about. Gauging the importance of a mobile app will determine how much time I might spend on mobile-specific features and optimising the UI for mobile devices.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>If the navigation app is used through a web browser, it that a disadvantage or advantage to you</td>
      <td>Although I am almost certainly going to make the front-end using web technologies, it will be useful to know if my users have any complaints or perceived drawbacks regarding web apps, so that I can try and address them.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Is it important for the navigation app to work while you're offline? What situations could you see yourself using this feature in?</td>
      <td>This will help determine how much of the app should work offline, e.g. whether map data should be downloaded on demand or pre-downloaded. I may use tools like service workers to keep the web app functional when offline.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

##### Initial interview with Andrew

I asked Andrew my research questions and gained useful insight into how pedestrian routing is used in the real world. Key takeaways were:

- Google Maps lacks most smaller paths, making it less useful for countryside navigation or walks. An app that includes these would be very desirable.
- Otherwise, Andrew found Google Maps intuitive and easy to use

- MR: Alright, I'm going to be recording-
- AS: Hi Mish
- MR: Hello! Are you alright if I ask you some questions for my project?
- AS: No.
- MR: Yes.
- AS: Yes, I am
- MR: Which is going to be a project on pedestrian routing, so it will be a navigation app, basically. Okay, I'd like to know first of all, how often you use a app or website to get directions, at all.
- AS: Probably about once every two weeks, when I'm going somewhere new... how long a journey will take, \[by] car, or just walking
- MR: So you'd say it's especially useful if you're going somewhere new?
- AS: Yes, definitely
- MR: Okay. And how often do you use an app for pedestrian navigation? So for just walking
- AS: I'd say it's about 50/50 with using it for cars, honestly... if I need to just find out how to get somewhere if I don't have a car, which is quite important for me-
- MR: Yeah, that's fair, yeah. Any situations where you find it especially useful to have that pedestrian routing available? Or is it just in general if you're walking somewhere?
- AS: Well, yeah, that, but I've found it's also quite useful when I'm trying to find out where someone is, if they give you their location so you can route to that using, Google Maps, usually.

##### Initial interview with James

My initial interview with James was conducted via email. It was very valuable to understand he uses similar navigation apps, and how they compare.

###### Key takeaways

- There are a variety of navigation apps available, each with their own advantages and drawbacks
- Battery usage during navigation on mobile is a an important consideration for James
- Pedestrian navigation is most useful in unfamiliar urban areas (as I expected)
- Many navigation apps (Google Maps, Magic Earth) are optimised for driving and therefore don't give ideal pedestrian routes

###### Desired features

- Efficient battery use during navigation (if a live navigation feature is added)
- Warnings if the surfaces on the route are poor
- Avoiding wet and muddy routes based on time of year and surface type
- A list of directions for sharing with others

##### Follow-up discussions with Andrew

<!-- TODO -->

#### Similar solutions

As part of my research, I will investigate other programs that provide pedestrian routing. This will include programs that are solely routing engines, as well as map apps that have routing features built in.

##### OsmAnd (map app)

OsmAnd ([website](https://osmand.net/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OsmAnd#Navigation)) is a mobile map app that uses OSM data and has routing that runs on-device for a range of transport modes. I have personally found its pedestrian routing to be very good in real-word use, so I will be using it as my primary point of reference to compare my engine's routes with.

##### Magic Earth (map app)

Magic Earth ([website](https://www.magicearth.com/)) is a similar mobile map app, suggested by my stakeholder James.

##### Google Maps (map app)

Google Maps ([website](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/about), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps#Directions_and_transit)) is a popular web app and mobile app.

##### Valhalla (routing engine)

> Valhalla is an open source routing engine and accompanying libraries for use with OpenStreetMap data. Valhalla also includes tools like time+distance matrix computation, isochrones, elevation sampling, map matching and tour optimization (Travelling Salesman).[^valhalla-readme]

[^valhalla-readme]: Valhalla readme file (<https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/blob/3a385045919967a14d5c9cc57610b2111936ac64/README.md>), accessed 17 September 2024

Valhalla is written in C++.

##### Open Source Routing Machine (routing engine)

> High performance routing engine written in C++ designed to run on OpenStreetMap data.[^osrm-readme]

[^osrm-readme]: OSRM readme file (<https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/blob/appropiately adjust routing wrights/README.md>), accessed 19 September 2024

Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) ([website](https://project-osrm.org/)) is a can perform car, bicycle, and pedestrian routing engine with source code available on GitHub ([Project-OSRM/osrm-backend](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend)).

###### Algorithm

OSRM either uses contraction hierarchies or multilevel Dijkstra's algorithm, with its documentation recommending to use the multi-level Dijkstra pipeline.[^osrm-pipelines]

[^osrm-pipelines]: OSRM readme file, "Quick Start" (<https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/blob/appropiately adjust routing wrights/README.md#quick-start>), accessed 19 September 2024

###### Experience

Below is an example route that demonstrates two features I like about OSRM: it suggests an equally-valid alternative route (translucent and dotted) as well as the main one (solid), and it gets onto the pavement as soon as possible.

![A screenshot of a route overlaid onto a map. The start point is on a road but the route goes onto the pavement to the side of the road at the next crossing](assets/osrm.png)

### Essential features

Based on my own ideas, initial stakeholder interviews, and research of similar programs, I have produced a list of essential features which will provide the most value to my program's users.

#### Route generation

The core utility of a navigation app comes from the route it can generate. It should be able to produce a safe, legal, and fast route between the two provided points.

#### Drawing the route on a map

My stakeholder interviews, especially with Andrew, have shown that having the route displayed on a map is often the most valuable way to present the information. This will be done with the Leaflet.js library, by displaying an interactive base map that uses the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF) raster tile server (<https://tile.openstreetmap.org/>). The route will then be overlaid with a coloured highlight along the paths that make up the route.

### Limitations of the system

To keep the project manageable and ensure I can focus on producing the features that will be of most value to my stakeholders, I have limited the scope in a few key areas: geographic scope, routing scope, and navigation features.

#### Geographic

The navigation app will only support start and end locations that are in the United Kingdom, specifically those that are within the United Kingdom region provided by Geofabrik, as specified in the .poly file at <https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/united-kingdom.poly>.

Advantages of limiting this scope:

- OSM tagging conventions can vary based on region, but conventions are consistent within the United Kingdom
- I am familiar with the UK's road (e.g. A-road, B-road) classifications, and path classifications (e.g. bridleways, public footpaths), which will mean I can appropriately adjust routing weights
- If I want to download the entire map data for the UK during development, it will be a manageable file size (1.7 GB, compared to 76.6 GB for the entire planet)
- It will help ensure only land routing is necessary <!-- TODO -->

#### Routing features

While the app will support a number of options to customise the routing graph weights for different pedestrian routing use-cases, the scope of routing features will be limited to those useful for pedestrians (including walking, or using a scooter or wheelchair). Adding support for other modes of transport, like public transport, cycling, or driving, is out of scope for this project.

Focusing on pedestrian navigation is justified because it has been identified as an important tool for my target persona (as shown in my [initial interview with Andrew](#initial-interview-with-andrew)), as well as being an area where other navigation apps like Google Maps and Magic Earth fall short (as mentioned by James in [his initial interview](#initial-interview-with-james)). By filling this gap in the market of available apps, I will be able to achieve the app's goal of making it easier to navigate by foot.

This will help keep the development time of the project manageable, as well as ensuring that the app does its one job well.

#### Navigation features

<!-- TODO we won't have live navigation and some other Googhmre Maps feaqtures -->
