# Pedestrian routing using open map data

A-level Computer Science programming project

## Problem definition

A routing engine is a piece of software that calculates a route between two points in the world, following a pre-defined network of paths or roads. Routing engines first became commonly used with satnavs that provide live directions for driving. Nowadays, mobile apps perform the same task, and can be used for driving as well as walking or cycling.

Modern routing engines use geographic data of roads to

## Justification of computational approach

The task of finding an efficient route between two geographic locations has some complexities, such as the need for an algorithm to chose which paths to explore without knowing for sure which ones will be optimal. However, these challenges have successfully been overcome by a variety of programs that incorporate routing engines. The four <!--points--> that make this task solvable with an algorithm are an initial situation, clear inputs and outputs, clearly defined logic, and a clear goal. These will be discussed in detail below.

### Initial situation

The routing engine is provided with coordinates for a starting point, and coordinates for the ending point. The initial situation for the program will be a graph that represents a network of paths for the area that will be covered by the routing query. The graph will be generated by processing map data from OpenStreetMap with the following steps:

1. Filter the data to extract ways that represent a walkable section of a route, e.g. paths, roads, plazas. This will be done by checking for corresponding top-level tags, e.g. `highway=footway`.
2. 

### Clear goal

Its goal is to provide the user with a safe and efficient route to get from the start point to the end point, on foot.

### Clear inputs and outputs

Its outputs would be a list of directions that the user can follow to navigate from the start to the end.

### Clearly defined logic

It will use this graph to find the optimal route between the two points using a pathfinding algorithm such as A*.
